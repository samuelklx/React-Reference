# React Intro Example
React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. Components can be reused throughout your app, which makes it easier to maintain and update your code.

In React, components are typically written as JavaScript functions or classes. They can accept inputs called "props" (short for properties) and return a React element that describes how a section of the UI should look. React components are JavaScript functions that return markup. This markup is typically written in a syntax called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. When the component is rendered, React will create a corresponding DOM element based on the returned markup.

In this example, we will create a simple React component that displays a heading with the text "Develop. Preview. Ship." using the React library. We will use the ReactDOM library to render our component to the DOM.

For more information on how react works, you can check out the official React documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

<body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- The React library is included via a CDN (Content Delivery Network) link. This allows us to use React in our HTML file without having to install it locally. -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>

    <!-- The ReactDOM library is also included via a CDN link. This library provides methods for interacting with the DOM and rendering React components to the page. -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

    <!-- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows us to use the latest JavaScript features, including JSX syntax, in our code. We include it via a CDN link so we can write our React components using JSX. -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Now we can use the React and ReactDOM libraries to create and render our React components. -->

    <!-- This was the original javascript that was included in #1TheDOMExample. 
    This is what is being replaced by our new react component -->
    <!-- <script type=""text/javascript"> 
        
        // const app = document.getElementById('app');
        // const header = document.createElement('h1');
        // const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
        // const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
        // header.appendChild(headerContent); 
        // app.appendChild(header); 
        </script> -->

    <!-- This is the new script. Note that the type is now JSX, rather than JavaScript. -->
    <!-- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.-->
    <script type="text/jsx">
        const app = document.getElementById('app');
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app); // Create a root for the React app. This will be the entry point for our React component.
        root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>); 
    </script>
