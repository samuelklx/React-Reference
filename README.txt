# React Reference

This repository provides a collection of HTML files that demonstrate the foundational concepts of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable components, manage state, and efficiently update the DOM using a virtual DOM.

## Overview of React
React is a declarative, component-based library that simplifies the process of building interactive UIs. It uses JavaScript and JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript) to define components and their behavior. React's key features include:
- **Components**: Reusable building blocks for UI.
- **Props**: Mechanism for passing data between components.
- **State**: Local data storage for components to manage dynamic behavior.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates the UI by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.

## Overview of JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the dynamic behavior of web applications. It is used in React to define components, handle events, and manage application logic.

## File Descriptions
This repository contains a series of HTML files that progressively introduce React concepts:

1. **#1TheDOMExample.html**  
   Demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM using plain JavaScript. This serves as a baseline for understanding how React simplifies DOM updates.

2. **#2ReactIntro.html**  
   Introduces React by replacing manual DOM manipulation with a simple React component that renders a heading.

3. **#3ComponentsPropsState.html**  
   Explains how to create reusable components in React and introduces the concept of props for passing data to components.

4. **#4NestingComponents.html**  
   Shows how to nest components within each other to build more complex UIs.

5. **#5DisplayingDataWProps.html**  
   Demonstrates how to use props to pass data between components and render dynamic content.

6. **#6ListIteration.html**  
   Placeholder for future content that will cover iterating over lists in React to render multiple components dynamically.

## How to Use
Each HTML file is self-contained and includes the necessary React and Babel libraries via CDN. Open the files in a browser to see the examples in action. The inline comments in the scripts provide detailed explanations of the code.

This repository is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn React and understand its core principles.
